# HelloTrivia

My attempt at creating a trivia game using the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com), aka biting off more than I can chew.

Realized this was portfolio worthy halfway through building it. ~~I'll deploy the app to github pages with a proper domain once it's finished. For now it's viewable on [codesandbox](https://nq41b.csb.app).~~
Now playable here [https://ayameu.github.io/HelloTrivia](https://ayameu.github.io/HelloTrivia).
